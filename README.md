# Kickstarter-Analysis
Module one challenge

Overview of Project:

  In this project, Louise discover that one of her plays "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal. With this approach, she wants to know the relationship between launch dates and their funding goal. To achieve the requirement of analyzing the "Kickstarter" dataset I will be using an Excel pivot table and line chart to analyze. This file also includes the challenges that I encountered during filtering the criteria and the final result. 

Analysis and Chanllenges:

Based on the Launch Date

  The picture below shows that the percentage of successful and failed events seems to work along with each other from Jan to Nov. Between these two months, there are three high peaks and two downward forces. However, the downforce occurred in March and September. looking at these two months' event numbers displays that the total amount of events is lower than other months’ events. On the other hand, Dec has a high percentage of failed outcomes.

Based on Goal

  People are willing to donate below the money at 20000 dollars and the section between 35000 to 44999 dollars. The willingness didn’t come close to the same trend of hing goal low donation. It's considerable that the number of goals does not really affect greatly on the outcome.

Challenges

While dealing with the goal-based line chart, I was struggling with the countifs function. The problem is that I misunderstand the meaning of using "plays" as criteria in the Subcategory. I thought the instruction want me to filter the column to "plays" and then collect the outcome of the goal range. Then, I kept working on the wrong information, and the chart I have was extremely different than the right one. In this case, I remember we were taught to search for the answer by ourselves and try to break down the problem. After then, I thought after watching a tutor of counties function on Youtube, I had realized that I had miss-understand the instruction. Fortunately, It worked out great.

Result:

  May is an outstanding month that has the highest performance within the months. I believe that it was due to the students' summer vacation because the amount of time has increased and the weather allows people to participate in events. Moreover, Dec had occurred an extreme downforce on the percentage of success. I believe the reason for this phenomenon is that poeple are willing to gather in-home and enjoy their meal with family. Also, snowing could affect the outcome too. 
  
  In the goals-based chart is hard to tell the relation between goals and the success rate, but we can know that people are willing to donate in the price section at 5000 dollars below and 35000 to 44999 dollars. Other than these two price sections, the events have a higher failure rate.
  
  Overall, It is difficult to provide more information with goals and launch dates. Launch dates required more surrounding information because a story can not only be told by timeline. It is important to know what is happening at the same time in order to make the connection. It will be great to combine the plays where the events hold.
